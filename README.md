# Blackjack Game

This project is a simple, web-based Blackjack game developed using HTML and CSS.

## Project Description

This Blackjack game allows users to play the popular casino card game directly in their web browser. The game features a user-friendly interface and intuitive controls, making it accessible to both new and experienced players.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Used for structuring the content of the web page.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web page and creating a visually appealing design.

## Game Rules

The game follows the standard rules of Blackjack:
- The goal is to have your cards' total value as close to 21 as possible without exceeding it.
- Each player is dealt two cards initially.
- Players can choose to 'Hit' to take another card, or 'Stand' to stop taking cards.
- If a player's cards' total value exceeds 21, they 'bust' and lose the game.

## How to Play

Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser to start the game. Click the 'Hit' button to take another card, or the 'Stand' button to stop taking cards.

## Future Improvements

Future updates will include features like betting, multiplayer support, and enhanced graphics.
